# [DDMAL](https://DDMAL.github.io/DDMAL-new-site)

This is the repository for the new DDMAL website distributed via GitHub Pages. It is a static website built using Jekyll, meaning that there is no backend presence, and the entirety of the site is stored in this repository, blog contents included. The formatting was adapted from the Lanyon theme, developed by Mark Otto.

## Local Setup

### macOS / Windows Install

You will need to download a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll. Follow steps 1 and 2 of [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) after installing Ruby. Note that mac users may need to install a package manager to configure the local Ruby version correctly, and [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) is a link with instructions on how-to.

Assuming you have [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed, open a terminal and clone the repository into any known location on your computer. The documents folder is recommended, though it is up to you.

### Configuration and building site locally

```
git clone https://github.com/DDMAL/ddmal.github.io.git
```

Enter the directory with `cd ddmal.github.io`, and pull from the repository to your local folder. Specifically, pull from the 'master' branch, the branch used by GitHub Pages to host the site.

```
git pull origin master
```

At this point, the site is able to be edited and run locally. Assuming steps 1 and 2 of the Jekyll documentation were followed correctly, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

The built site can then be viewed at 'localhost:4000'. The `--watch` option automatically checks for updates to the local files and can be immediately viewed by refreshing the page. `--watch` is not supported by Windows, thus the command above will need to be rerun after each edit.

### Important!

- For macOS users, it may be necessary to uncomment the lines under ```macOs-specific dependencies``` in the Gemfile and comment those under ```Windows-specific dependencies```. 
- For Windows users, comment everything under ```macOs-specific dependencies``` and uncomment the lines under ```Windows-specific dependencies```. 

After making changes to the 'Gemfile' at the root directory of the repository, run:

```
bundle install
```
to install any updated or newly-added gems for the build. The site can then be rebuilt with `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`.

### Troubleshooting for macOS

- If you are using Homebrew for package management, make sure to run ```brew doctor``` to check if there are any warnings that need to be addressed.

- General compilation issues may occur due to incompatible versions of Ruby. One recommendation would be to use Homebrew to get `ruby-install` and `chruby` for compilation, installation, and switching between different Ruby versions. After installing, the following configurations in the ~/.zshrc file are necessary for correct functionality: 

  - ```source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh```, to make the chruby program available in the shell.
  - ```source /opt/homebrew/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh```, to enable auto-switching of Rubies specified by .ruby-version files. 
  - ```chruby ruby-x.y.z```, sets the desired Ruby version (note that you may need to install it first via ```ruby-install ruby x.y.z```). Where x.y.z is to be replaced with the version number. When switching between Ruby versions, this is the line that needs to be updated. Check for correct setup with ```ruby -v```, it should print out a line that starts with *ruby x.y.z*. 
- using Ruby version 3.0.0 may cause additional failures when executing ```bundle exec jekyll serve```, a possible fix could be to uncomment the `gem` command under `# macOS dependency for Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher` in the Gemfile. If that does not work, then it is possible that a newer version is needed, so you may have to execute ```bundle add webrick```. Note that running the `bundle add webrick` command will update the Gemfile with a specific webrick version. The command performs `bundle install` automatically so it is not needed to execute it again.
- a Ruby version higher than 2.6 is needed to execute any `gem` or `bundle` commands.
- if you installed the newest version of Ruby, downgrading to an older version may be necessary for some dependencies to work. 

## Creating your lab member page

Inside the **_lab_members** folder, there are five different folders that contain markdown files for your respective page on the website as a lab member. Choose the folder related to your affiliation, and copy an existing user file to add your own details to. Vanilla templates for each of the five lab member categories are also available in the **TEMPLATES** folder at the root directory. Copy, paste, and rename in the correct subfolder within **_lab_members**.

When adding an image for a lab member page, place it in the **assets/lab_members** directory. Reference the exact filename for the *photo* variable in the respective lab member's markdown file.

### Variables

Here is the updated list of variables to edit for each lab member's markdown page. If a list is shown in brackets ([]), the possible variable values can **only** be one of the entries. Variables in italics are optional. These are also case-sensitive for the time being!

* layout: **DON'T EDIT**
* category: [Principal, Manager, Postdoc, PhD, Masters, Undergraduate, Alumni]
* title: your name
* degree: what degree you are pursuing (ex: BSc in Computer Science, MA in Music Technology, PhD in Music Technology
* photo: the exact file name (with extension) in the **assets/lab_member** directory
* *cv*: the exact file name of CV (with extension) stored locally in **assets/lab_member/cv**
* *social*:
  * *github_username*: [USERNAME] from https://github.com/[USERNAME]
  * *linkedin_username*: [USERNAME] from https://www.linkedin.com/in/[USERNAME]/
  * *instagram_username*: [USERNAME] from https://www.instagram.com/[USERNAME]/
  * *bandcamp_username*: [USERNAME] from https://[USERNAME].bandcamp.com/releases
  * *soundcloud_username*: [USERNAME] from https://soundcloud.com/[USERNAME]
  * *twitter_username*: [USERNAME] from https://www.twitter.com/[USERNAME]

* *research_interests*: any number of hyphenated entries for research areas of interest (check template or an existing user page)
* *academic_record*: any number of hyphenated entries for previously pursued degrees and respective universities
* *publications*:

**Write your biography below the second '---' on the markdown page.**

## CMS

<br>

![](readme-img/site-to-forestry.png)

<br>

The content management system (CMS) used for this site is [Forestry](https://forestry.io/). This is where blog entries and website contents are added, edited, and maintained. 

Blog entries and website content are written in Markdown, which makes it easy to add text, links, images, and lists to a new post. Here is a [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to consult for any necessary formatting.

In the picture above, you can see how each of the links for navigation on the DDMAL website correspond to an editable tab on the sidebar of the CMS. The next section will explain in further detail how each component is edited and what output should be expected.

If the blog post will feature images and files, upload them to the 'Media' library which can be accessed on the sidebar. To add them in the WYSIWYG post editor, hit `ctrl+shift+u`. This will open the media library where each image or file can be selected and added inline to the post. The images will be center-justified when posted to the blog.

### CMS Navigation

Any content that needs to be added or adjusted on the DDMAL site can mostly be done in the Forestry CMS. When selecting any of the tabs on the sidebar, you will either be taken to a Markdown file or folder. When editing or adding a new Markdown file, the default editing style is a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWIG [wiss-e-wig]) editor. Formatting for each paragraph, header, link, etc. will automatically take place, and explicit Markdown syntax will automatically be reflected in the editor. If it is preferred, click on the ellipsis in the upper right hand corner to change to edit in 'Raw' mode, where the Markdown is explicitly written. Markdown files can also be injected with HTML if the default styling is not satisfactory.

<br>

![](readme-img/wysiwyg-vs-raw.png)

<br>


Every Markdown file has a number of fields in the leftmost column to edit which are referred to as Front Matter. This information is used for automatically placing content where the CMS suggests it should be added. Each tab on the sidebar is restricted to a subset of Front Matter templates respectively that require the content manager to add titles, descriptors, and other information for organizing the new content properly.

<br>

![](readme-img/alumni-example.png)

<br>

In the example above, selecting the group "alumni" from the dropdown for __Role__ will automatically place the individual in that respective group on the website. Other details such as "link" and "affiliation" are not required, but they can be used to link to others' work and provide more context.

Some tabs such as "People" only include editable front matter as their respective Markdown files contain little information other than names, affiliations, and links to external websites. There is no need for a body of content for those files. Otherwise, tabs like "Research" and "Blog" include front matter and Markdown editing for correctly filing and editing entire pages.

### Organization

For most of the tabs on the sidebar in Forestry, there is a corresponding Markdown file for each at the root of the respective tab's folder. For example, the **Software** tab features a file called **software.md** within it. This is the the landing page that a user will see when selecting "Software" from the navigation bar on the actual website.

The folder architecture automatically appends to the URL based on the progression from the root URL through each child folder. The front matter for the **software.md** file at the root of the **Software** folder requires a "permalink" field since we would like to see that page at "DDMAL-new-site/software/" instead of "DDMAL-new-site/software/software/". The permalink should only need to be specified for landing pages found within the subfolder they are representing with the same name. Here's a quick example:

* software [**folder**]
  * software.md (permalink: /software/) ---|
  * LibMEI.md <---------------------------|
  * neon.md   <-----------------------------|

The **LibMEI.md** and **neon.md** files are linked to from **software.md**, and their URLs will immediately be correct without the need for a permalink since they are a subset of the software landing page inside the software folder. As folders are nested in an increasing website architecture, the same principle applies, and each parent folder will be one further step back in the entire URL.


### Media

Blog posts, workshops, and individual pages often include images and downloads on the DDMAL website, and Forestry includes a "Media" area to upload these files. On the sidebar under "Site", select "Media" to view all of the existing media present in the website's repository. By selecting the "Upload" button in the top right corner, you can upload any files directly to the CMS/repository for later usage in various posts.

When writing or editing a Markdown entry that will include an image or file, hit `ctrl+shift+u` to open the Media folder. Then, you can select any existing media and drop it right into the new post; Forestry handles the file path automatically, and it should not need to be altered. Images will be center-justified when posted to the website.

### Updating citations

There are two parts of this site updated from Zotero group libraries.
(OMR Bibliography and DDMAL)
https://www.zotero.org/groups/424851/omr_bibliography
https://www.zotero.org/groups/2415821/ddmal

The basic functionality is documented on the SIMSSA site here:
https://github.com/DDMAL/simssa.github.io#updating-citations-locally

This repo has two different versions of that script, one for general
DDMAL citation updates and one for the Zotero bibliography.

(Ideally someone will make a general-purpose parser that works for all
these scenarios but I didn't get to it -EH)
