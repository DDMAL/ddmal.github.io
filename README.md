# [DDMAL](https://DDMAL.github.io/DDMAL-new-site)

This is the repository for the new DDMAL website distributed via GitHub Pages. It is a static website built using Jekyll, meaning that there is no backend presence, and the entirety of the site is stored in this repository, blog contents included. The formatting was adapted from the Lanyon theme, developed by Mark Otto.

## Setup

You will need to download a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll. Follow steps 1 and 2 of [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) after installing Ruby. 

Create a new directory and initialize an empty repository in it. 

```
mkdir <your_repo>
cd <your_repo>
git init
```

Set the remote repository to the url of the GitHub repository.

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/DDMAL/DDMAL-new-site.git
```

Pull from the repository to your local folder. Specifically, pull from the 'gh-pages' branch, the branch used by GitHub Pages to host the site. 

```
git pull origin gh-pages
```

By default, this will create one branch locally (master). Create a new local 'gh-pages' branch from the master.

```
git checkout gh-pages
```

The command above both creates the branch and switches to it. This new branch will include everything that master contained from the time of its creation. 

At this point, the site is able to be edited and run locally. Assuming steps 1 and 2 of the Jekyll documentation were followed correctly, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

The built site can then be viewed at 'localhost:4000/DDMAL-new-site/'. The `--watch` option automatically checks for updates to the local files and can be immediately viewed by refreshing the page. `--watch` is not supported by Windows, thus the command above will need to be rerun after each edit. 

If any changes need to be made to the 'Gemfile', run: 

```
bundle install
```

to install any updated or newly-added gems for the build. Then, the site can be rebuilt with `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`. 

## Options

Lanyon includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Themes

Lanyon ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.


### Reverse layout

Reverse the page orientation with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```


### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` tag within the `sidebar.html` layout to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title =="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```

## Development

Lanyon has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**
